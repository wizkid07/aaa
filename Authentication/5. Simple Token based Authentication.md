## Summary

- Cross-origin API calls can be enabled for web clients using CORS. Enabling cookies on cross-origin calls is error-prone and becoming more difficult over time. HTML 5 Web Storage provides an alternative to cookies for storing cookies directly.
    
- Web Storage prevents CSRF attacks but can be more vulnerable to token exfiltration via XSS. You should ensure that you prevent XSS attacks before moving to this token storage model.
    
- The standard Bearer authentication scheme for HTTP can be used to transmit a token to an API, and to prompt for one if not supplied. While originally designed for OAuth2, the scheme is now widely used for other forms of tokens.
    
- Authentication tokens should be hashed when stored in a database to prevent them being used if the database is compromised. Message authentication codes (MACs) can be used to protect tokens against tampering and forgery. Hash-based MAC (HMAC) is a standard secure algorithm for constructing a MAC from a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256.
    
- Database access controls and row-level security policies can be used to further harden a database against attacks, limiting the damage that can be done. Database encryption can be used to protect sensitive attributes but is a complex topic with many failure cases.



### Preflight requests

A preflight request occurs when a browser would normally block the request for violating the same-origin policy. The browser makes an HTTP OPTIONS request to the server asking if the request should be allowed. The server can either deny the request or else allow it with restrictions on the allowed headers and methods.

### CORS headers

![[Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 2.01.57 PM.png]]

`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:` `true` header from preflight requests; otherwise, the browser will not send the session cookie

Browsers will also ignore any Set-Cookie headers in the response to a CORS request unless the response contains `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:` `true`. This header must therefore be returned on responses to both preflight requests and the actual request for cookies to work. Once you move to non-cookie methods later in this chapter, you can remove these headers.

To add CORS support, you’ll implement a simple filter that lists a set of allowed origins, shown in listing 5.1. For all requests, if the Origin header in the request is in the allowed list then you should set the basic Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header

If you wish to use cross-site cookies you must now explicitly opt-out of SameSite protections by adding the SameSite=none and Secure attributes to those cookies, but this can cause problems in some web browsers (see [https://www.chromium.org/updates/ same-site/incompatible-clients](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients)). Google, Apple, and Mozilla are all becoming more aggressive in blocking cross-site cookies to prevent tracking and other security or privacy issues. It’s clear that the future of cookies will be restricted to HTTP requests within the same site and that alternative approaches, such as those discussed in the rest of this chapter, must be used for all other cases.

### Why cookies ?

Cookies are such a compelling option for web-based clients because they provide the three components needed to implement token-based authentication in a neat pre-packaged bundle (figure 5.3):

- A standard way to communicate tokens between the client and the server, in the form of the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Browsers will handle these headers for your clients automatically, and make sure they are only sent to the correct site.
    
- A convenient storage location for tokens on the client, that persists across page loads (and reloads) and redirections. Cookies can also survive a browser restart and can even be automatically shared between devices, such as with Apple’s Handoff functionality.[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/05.htm#pgfId-1176607)
    
- Simple and robust server-side storage of token state, as most web frameworks support cookie storage out of the box just like Spark.


### Storing token state in a database

For these reasons, many production implementations of token storage opt for non-relational database backends, such as the Redis in-memory key-value store ([https:// redis.io](https://redis.io/)), or a NoSQL JSON store that emphasizes speed and availability.

	Authentication tokens are validated on every request, so the cost of a database transaction for every lookup can soon add up. On the other hand, tokens are usually extremely simple in structure, so they don’t need a complicated database schema or sophisticated integrity constraints


 To be secure, a token ID should be generated with a high degree of entropy from a cryptographically-secure random number generator (RNG). In Java, this means the random data should come from a `SecureRandom` object


entropy is a measure of how likely it is that a random variable has a given value. When a variable is said to have 128 bits of entropy, that means that there is a 1 in 2128 chance of it having one specific value rather than any other value. The more entropy a variable has, the more difficult it is to guess what value it has. For long-lived values that should be un-guessable by an adversary with access to large amounts of computing power, an entropy of 128 bits is a secure minimum. If your API issues a very large number of tokens with long expiry times, then you should consider a higher entropy of 160 bits or more


Database tokens Implementation

❶ Use a SecureRandom to generate unguessable token IDs.

❸ Serialize the token attributes as JSON.

❹ Use a helper method to reconstruct the token from the JSON.

❺ Revoke a token on logout by deleting it from the database.


### The Bearer authentication scheme

A bearer token is a token that can be used at an API simply by including it in the request. Any client that has a valid token is authorized to use that token and does not need to supply any further proof of authentication. A bearer token can be given to a third party to grant them access without revealing user credentials but can also be used easily by attackers if stolen.

`Authorization: Bearer QDAmQ9TStkDCpVK5A9kFowtYn2k`


```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="users", error="invalid_token",
        error_description="Token has expired"
```


you might return `realm="users"` from one endpoint and `realm="admins"` from another, to indicate to the client that they should obtain a token from a different login endpoint for administrators compared to regular users

Implementation

❶ Check that the Authorization header is present and uses the Bearer scheme.

❷ The token ID is the rest of the header value.

❸ If the token is expired, then tell the client using a standard response.

❹ Check that the Authorization header is present and uses the Bearer scheme.

❺ The token ID is the rest of the header value.

Prompt for Bearer authentication if no credentials are present.

```
public void requireAuthentication(Request request, Response response) {
    if (request.attribute("subject") == null) {
        response.header("WWW-Authenticate", "Bearer");      ❶
        halt(401);
    }
}
```

### Deleting expired tokens

should implement a periodic task to delete expired tokens to prevent the database growing too large

index the expiry column on the database

### Storing tokens in Web Storage


![[Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 4.27.01 PM.png]]

Web Storage is simple to use, especially when compared with how hard it was to extract a cookie in JavaScript. Browsers that support the Web Storage API, which includes most browsers in current use, add two new fields to the standard JavaScript window object:

- The `sessionStorage` object can be used to store data until the browser window or tab is closed.
    
- The `localStorage` object stores data until it is explicitly deleted, saving the data even over browser restarts.

### Updating the CORS filter

❶ Remove the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header.

❷ Remove X-CSRF-Token from the allowed headers.

### XSS attacks on Web Storage

Exfiltration is the act of stealing tokens and sensitive data from a page and sending them to the attacker without the victim being aware. The attacker can then use the stolen tokens to log in as the user from the attacker’s own device.

## Hardening database token storage

A database token store is subject to several threats, even if you secure the communications between the API and the database using TLS. An attacker may gain direct access to the database or via an injection attack. Read access allows the attacker to steal tokens and gain access to the API as any user. Write access allows them to create fake tokens or alter their own token. If they gain delete access, then they can delete other users’ tokens, denying them access.

Methods 

**Hash tokens and store in database**

Unlike user passwords, authentication tokens have high entropy, so you don’t need to use an expensive password hashing algorithm like Scrypt. Instead you can use a fast, cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256


### Authenticating tokens with HMAC

Simple hashing does not prevent an attacker with write access from inserting a fake token that gives them access to another user’s account

Most databases are also not designed to provide constant-time equality comparisons, so database lookups can be vulnerable to timing attacks

You can eliminate both issues by calculating a message authentication code (MAC), such as the standard hash-based MAC (HMAC). HMAC works like a normal cryptographic hash function, but incorporates a secret key known only to the API server.

A message authentication code (MAC) is an algorithm for computing a short fixed-length authentication tag from a message and a secret key. A user with the same secret key will be able to compute the same tag from the same message, but any change in the message will result in a completely different tag. An attacker without access to the secret cannot compute a correct tag for any message. HMAC (hash-based MAC) is a widely used secure MAC based on a cryptographic hash function. For example, HMAC-SHA-256 is HMAC using the SHA-256 hash function.


![[Pasted image 20230928170459.png]]


The database token ID is left untouched, but an HMAC authentication tag is computed and attached to the token ID returned to API clients. When a token is presented to the API, the authentication tag is first validated and then stripped from the token ID before passing it to the database token store. If the authentication tag is invalid, then the token is rejected before any database lookup occurs.

```
package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;
 
import spark.Request;
 
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.*;
import java.util.*;
 
public class HmacTokenStore implements TokenStore {
 
    private final TokenStore delegate;                         ❶
    private final Key macKey;                                  ❶
 
    public HmacTokenStore(TokenStore delegate, Key macKey) {   ❶
        this.delegate = delegate;
        this.macKey = macKey;
    }
 
    @Override
    public String create(Request request, Token token) {
        var tokenId = delegate.create(request, token);         ❷
        var tag = hmac(tokenId);                               ❷
 
        return tokenId + '.' + Base64url.encode(tag);          ❸
    }
 
    private byte[] hmac(String tokenId) {
        try {
            var mac = Mac.getInstance(macKey.getAlgorithm());  ❹
            mac.init(macKey);                                  ❹
            return mac.doFinal(                                ❹
                    tokenId.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); ❹
        } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
 
    @Override
    public Optional<Token> read(Request request, String tokenId) {
        return Optional.empty(); // To be written
    }
}
```

Timing attacks against HMAC tag validation are a common vulnerability, so it is critical that you use `MessageDigest.isEqual` or an equivalent constant-time equality function.

### Key Store

A keystore is an encrypted file that contains cryptographic keys and TLS certificates used by your API. A keystore is usually protected by a password.

Java supports loading keys from keystores using the `java.security.KeyStore` class, and you can create a keystore using the `keytool` command shipped with the JDK. Java provides several keystore formats, but you should use the PKCS #12 format ([https:// tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292)) because that is the most secure option supported by keytool.

```

keytool -genseckey -keyalg HmacSHA256 -keysize 256 \     ❶
    -alias hmac-key -keystore keystore.p12 \
    -storetype PKCS12 \                                  ❷
    -storepass changeit

```
