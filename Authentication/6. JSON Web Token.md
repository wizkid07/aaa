## Summary

- Token state can be stored on the client by encoding it in JSON and applying HMAC authentication to prevent tampering.
    
- Sensitive token attributes can be protected with encryption, and efficient authenticated encryption algorithms can remove the need for a separate HMAC step.
    
- The JWT and JOSE specifications provide a standard format for authenticated and encrypted tokens but have historically been vulnerable to several serious attacks.
    
- When used carefully, JWT can be an effective part of your API authentication strategy but you should avoid the more error-prone parts of the standard.
    
- Revocation of stateless JWTs can be achieved by maintaining an allowlist or blocklist of tokens in the database. An allowlisting strategy is a secure default offering advantages over both pure stateless tokens and unauthenticated database tokens.


JWT

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs, pronounced “jots”) are a standard format for self-contained security tokens. A JWT consists of a set of claims about a user represented as a JSON object, together with a header describing the format of the token. JWTs are cryptographically protected against tampering and can also be encrypted.


Unlike Session or Database tokens JWTs are stateless.

The idea behind stateless tokens is simple. Rather than store the token state in the database, you can instead encode that state directly into the token ID and send it to the client. For example, you could serialize the token fields into a JSON object, which you then Base64url-encode to create a string that you can use as the token ID. When the token is presented back to the API, you then simply decode the token and parse the JSON to recover the attributes of the session.

JsonTokenStore

```
package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;
 
import org.json.*;
import spark.Request;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.*;
import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
 
public class JsonTokenStore implements TokenStore {
    @Override
    public String create(Request request, Token token) {
        var json = new JSONObject();
        json.put("sub", token.username);                            ❶
        json.put("exp", token.expiry.getEpochSecond());             ❶
        json.put("attrs", token.attributes);                        ❶
 
        var jsonBytes = json.toString().getBytes(UTF_8);            ❷
        return Base64url.encode(jsonBytes);                         ❷
    }
 
    @Override
    public Optional<Token> read(Request request, String tokenId) {
        try {
            var decoded = Base64url.decode(tokenId);                ❸
            var json = new JSONObject(new String(decoded, UTF_8));  ❸
            var expiry = Instant.ofEpochSecond(json.getInt("exp")); ❸
            var username = json.getString("sub");                   ❸
            var attrs = json.getJSONObject("attrs");                ❸
 
            var token = new Token(expiry, username);                ❸
            for (var key : attrs.keySet()) {                        ❸
                token.attributes.put(key, attrs.getString(key));    ❸
            }
 
            return Optional.of(token);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
    }
 
    @Override
    public void revoke(Request request, String tokenId) {
        // TODO                                                     ❹
    }
}
```
❶ Convert the token attributes into a JSON object.

❷ Encode the JSON object with URL-safe Base64-encoding.

❸ To read the token, decode it and parse the JSON to recover the attributes.

❹ Leave the revoke method blank for now.


Of course, as it stands, this code is completely insecure. Anybody can log in to the API and then edit the encoded token in their browser to change their username or other security attributes! In fact, they can just create a brand-new token themselves without ever logging in. You can fix that by reusing the `HmacTokenStore` that you created in chapter 5, as shown in figure 6.1. By appending an authentication tag computed with a secret key known only to the API server, an attacker is prevented from either creating a fake token or altering an existing one

❶ Construct the JsonTokenStore.

❷ Wrap it in a HmacTokenStore to ensure authenticity.

An HMAC tag is computed over the encoded JSON claims using a secret key. The HMAC tag is then itself encoded into URL-safe Base64 format and appended to the token, using a period as a separator. As a period is not a valid character in Base64 encoding, you can use this to find the tag later.

A basic authenticated JWT is almost exactly like the HMAC-authenticated JSON tokens that you produced in section 6.1.1, but with an additional JSON header that indicates the algorithm and other details of how the JWT was produced, as shown in figure 6.2. The Base64url-encoded format used for JWTs is known as the JWS Compact Serialization. JWS also defines another format, but the compact serialization is the most widely used for API tokens.

While JWT itself is just one specification ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)), it builds on a collection of standards collectively known as JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). JOSE itself consists of several related standards:

- JSON Web Signing (JWS, [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515)) defines how JSON objects can be authenticated with HMAC and digital signatures.
- JSON Web Encryption (JWE, [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516)) defines how to encrypt JSON objects.
- JSON Web Key (JWK, [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517)) describes a standard format for cryptographic keys and related metadata in JSON.
- JSON Web Algorithms (JWA, [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518)) then specifies signing and encryption algorithms to be used.

### The standard JWT claims

![[Screenshot 2023-09-28 at 5.42.35 PM.png]]

A replay attack occurs when an attacker captures a token sent by a legitimate party and later replays it on their own request.

Replay attacks are largely prevented by the use of TLS

### The JOSE header

Most of the flexibility of the JOSE and JWT standards is concentrated in the header, which is an additional JSON object that is included in the authentication tag and contains metadata about the JWT. For example, the following header indicates that the token is signed with HMAC-SHA-256 using a key with the given key ID:

{
  "alg": "HS256",          ❶
  "kid": "hmac-key-1"      ❷
}

Although seemingly innocuous, the JOSE header is one of the more error-prone aspects of the specifications, which is why the code you have written so far does not generate a header, and I often recommend that they are stripped when possible to create (nonstandard) headless JWT

A headless JWT is a JWT with the header removed. The recipient recreates the header from expected values. For simple use cases where you control the sender and recipient this can reduce the size and attack surface of using JWTs but the resulting JWTs are nonstandard. Where headless JWTs can’t be used, you should strictly validate all header values.

Cryptographic agility is the ability to change the algorithm used for securing messages or tokens in case weaknesses are discovered in one algorithm or a more performant alternative is required.

Although this is a good idea, the design in JOSE is less than ideal because the recipient must rely on the sender to tell them which algorithm to use to authenticate the message. This violates the principle that you should never trust a claim that you have not authenticated, and yet you cannot authenticate the JWT until you have processed this claim! This weakness was what allowed Tim McClean to confuse JWT libraries by changing the `alg` header.

Key rotation is the process of periodically changing the keys used to protect messages and tokens. Changing the key regularly ensures that the usage limits for a key are never reached and if any one key is compromised then it is soon replaced, limiting the time in which damage can be done.

A server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack occurs when an attacker can cause a server to make outgoing network requests under the attacker’s control. Because the server is on a trusted network behind a firewall, this allows the attacker to probe and potentially attack machines on the internal network that they could not otherwise access


###  Generating standard JWTs

. There are many JWT and JOSE libraries for most programming languages, and the [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) website maintains a list

```

public class SignedJwtTokenStore implements TokenStore {

               JWSVerifier verifier, JWSAlgorithm algorithm,  ❶
               String audience) {                             ❶
        this.signer = signer;                                 ❶

    }
 
    @Override
    public String create(Request request, Token token) {
        var claimsSet = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder()            ❷
                .subject(token.username)                      ❷
                .audience(audience)                           ❷
                .expirationTime(Date.from(token.expiry))      ❷
                .claim("attrs", token.attributes)             ❷
                .build();                                     ❷
        var header = new JWSHeader(JWSAlgorithm.HS256);       ❸
        var jwt = new SignedJWT(header, claimsSet);           ❸
        try {
            jwt.sign(signer);                                 ❹
            return jwt.serialize();                           ❺
        } catch (JOSEException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
 
    @Override
    public Optional<Token> read(Request request, String tokenId) {
        // TODO
        return Optional.empty();
    }
 
    @Override
    public void revoke(Request request, String tokenId) {
        // TODO
    }
}


```

❶ Pass in the algorithm, audience, and signer and verifier objects.

❷ Create the JWT claims set with details about the token.

❸ Specify the algorithm in the header and build the JWT.

❹ Sign the JWT using the JWSSigner object.

❺ Convert the signed JWT into the JWS compact serialization.


### Validating a signed JWT

❶ Parse the JWT and verify the HMAC signature using the JWSVerifier.

❷ Reject the token if the audience doesn’t contain your API’s base URI.

❸ Extract token attributes from the remaining JWT claims.

❹ If the token is invalid, then return a generic failure response.

    @Override
    public Optional<Token> read(Request request, String tokenId) {
        try {
            var jwt = SignedJWT.parse(tokenId);                    ❶
            
            if (!jwt.verify(verifier)) {                           ❶
                throw new JOSEException("Invalid signature");      ❶
            }                                                      ❶
 
            var claims = jwt.getJWTClaimsSet();
            if (!claims.getAudience().contains(audience)) {        ❷
                throw new JOSEException("Incorrect audience");     ❷
            }                                                      ❷
 
            var expiry = claims.getExpirationTime().toInstant();   ❸
            var subject = claims.getSubject();                     ❸
            var token = new Token(expiry, subject);                ❸
            var attrs = claims.getJSONObjectClaim("attrs");        ❸
            attrs.forEach((key, value) ->                          ❸
                    token.attributes.put(key, (String) value));    ❸
 
            return Optional.of(token);
        } catch (ParseException | JOSEException e) {
            return Optional.empty();                               ❹

## Encrypting sensitive attributes

A chosen ciphertext attack is an attack against an encryption scheme in which an attacker manipulates the encrypted ciphertext.

Many encryption algorithms only ensure the confidentiality of data that has been encrypted and don’t claim to protect the integrity of that data. This means that an attacker won’t be able to read any sensitive attributes in an encrypted token, but they may be able to alter them. For example, if you know that a token is encrypted with CTR mode and (when decrypted) starts with the string `user=brian`, you can change this to read `user=admin`

Authenticated encryption combines an encryption algorithm with a MAC. Authenticated encryption ensures confidentiality and integrity of messages.

An encrypted JWT using the JWE Compact Serialization looks superficially like the HMAC JWTs from section 6.2, but there are more components reflecting the more complex structure of an encrypted token, shown in figure 6.5. The five components of a JWE are:

![[Pasted image 20230928184515.png]]

1. The JWE header, which is very like the JWS header, but with two additional fields: `enc`, which specifies the encryption algorithm, and `zip`, which specifies an optional compression algorithm to be applied before encryption.
    
2. An optional encrypted key. This is used in some of the more complex encryption algorithms. It is empty for the direct symmetric encryption algorithm that is covered in this chapter.
    
3. The initialization vector or nonce used when encrypting the payload. Depending on the encryption method being used, this will be either a 12- or 16-byte random binary value that has been Base64url-encoded.
    
4. The encrypted ciphertext.
    
5. The MAC authentication tag.

## Using types for secure API design

Marker Interfaces

A marker interface is an interface that defines no new methods. It is used purely to indicate that the implementation has certain desirable properties.

## Handling token revocation

- You can add some minimal state to the database that lists a unique ID associated with the token. To revoke a JWT, you delete the corresponding record from the database. To validate the JWT, you must now perform a database lookup to check if the unique ID is still in the database. If it is not, then the token has been revoked. This is known as an allowlist.[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/06.htm#pgfId-1186936)
    
- A twist on the above scheme is to only store the unique ID in the database when the token is revoked, creating a blocklist of revoked tokens. To validate, make sure that there isn’t a matching record in the database. The unique ID only needs to be blocked until the token expires, at which point it will be invalid anyway. Using short expiry times helps keep the blocklist small.
    
- Rather than blocking individual tokens, you can block certain attributes of a set of tokens. For example, it is a common security practice to invalidate all of a user’s existing sessions when they change their password. Users often change their password when they believe somebody else may have accessed their account, so invalidating any existing sessions will kick the attacker out. Because there is no record of the existing sessions on the server, you could instead record an entry in the database saying that all tokens issued to user Mary before lunchtime on Friday should be considered invalid. This saves space in the database at the cost of increased query complexity.
    
- Finally, you can issue short-lived tokens and force the user to reauthenticate regularly. This limits the damage that can be done with a compromised token without needing any additional state on the server but provides a poor user experience. In chapter 7, you’ll use OAuth2 refresh tokens to provide a more transparent version of this pattern.


An idle timeout (or inactivity logout) automatically revokes an authentication token if it hasn’t been used for a certain amount of time. This can be used to automatically log out a user if they have stopped using your API but have forgotten to log out manually.
