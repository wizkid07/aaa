## Summary

- HTTP Basic authentication is awkward for web browser clients and has a poor user experience. You can use token-based authentication to provide a more natural login experience for these clients.
    
- For web-based clients served from the same site as your API, session cookies are a simple and secure token-based authentication mechanism.
    
- Session fixation attacks occur if the session cookie doesn’t change when a user authenticates. Make sure to always invalidate any existing session before logging the user in.
    
- CSRF attacks can allow other sites to exploit session cookies to make requests to your API without the user’s consent. Use SameSite cookies and the hash-based double-submit cookie pattern to eliminate CSRF attacks.


In token-based authentication, a user’s real credentials are presented once, and the client is then given a short-lived token. A token is typically a short, random string that can be used to authenticate API calls until the token expires.

By default, browsers allow JavaScript to send HTTP requests only to a server on the same origin that the script was loaded from. This is known as the same-origin policy (SOP)

### Drawbacks of HTTP authentication

- The user’s password is sent on every API call, increasing the chance of it accidentally being exposed by a bug in one of those operations.
- If you are implementing a microservice architecture (covered in chapter 10), then every microservice needs to securely handle those passwords.
- Verifying a password is an expensive operation
- There is no obvious way for the user to ask the browser to forget the password.


You should avoid HTTP Digest authentication in new applications
	sends a salted hash of the password instead of sending the raw value. Although this sounds like a security improvement, the hashing algorithm used by HTTP Digest, MD5, is considered insecure by modern standards

HTTP Bearer authentication scheme introduced by OAuth2 in RFC 6750 ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750)). This is a flexible token-based authentication scheme that is becoming widely used for API authentication


How simple token based authentication works ?

Traditionally, the only option was to store the token in an HTTP cookie, which the browser remembers and sends on subsequent requests to the same site until the cookie expires or is deleted. 

Cookies are still a great choice for first-party clients running on the same origin as the API they are talking to but can be difficult when dealing with third-party clients and clients hosted on other domains


## Session cookies

The simplest implementation of token-based authentication, and one that is widely implemented on almost every website, is cookie-based. After the user authenticates, the login endpoint returns a `Set-Cookie` header on the response that instructs the web browser to store a random session token in the cookie storage. Subsequent requests to the same site will include the token as a `Cookie` header. The server can then look up the cookie token in a database to see which user is associated with that token

cookies are associated with a domain, so the browser ensures that they are not accidentally sent to other sites. They can also be marked as Secure, which prevents the cookie being accidentally sent over a non-HTTPS connection where it might be intercepted

### Session fixation attacks

If the request did not have an existing session cookie, then this will create a new session. But if the request already contains an existing session cookie, then Spark will return that existing session and not create a new one. This can create a security vulnerability if an attacker is able to inject their own session cookie into another user’s web browser. Once the victim logs in, the API will change the username attribute in the session from the attacker’s username to the victim’s username. The attacker’s session token now allows them to access the victim’s account, as shown in figure 4.8. Some web servers will produce a session cookie as soon as you access the login page, allowing an attacker to obtain a valid session cookie before they have even logged in.

In a session fixation attack, the attacker first logs in to obtain a valid session token. They then inject that session token into the victim’s browser and trick them into logging in. If the existing session is not invalidating during login then the attacker’s session will be able to access the victim’s account.

A session fixation attack occurs when an API fails to generate a new session token after a user has authenticated. The attacker captures a session token from loading the site on their own device and then injects that token into the victim’s browser. Once the victim logs in, the attacker can use the original session token to access the victim’s account.


Vulnerable code

```


    public String create(Request request, Token token) {
 
        // WARNING: session fixation vulnerability!
        var session = request.session(true);                   ❶
 
        session.attribute("username", token.username);         ❷
        session.attribute("expiry", token.expiry);             ❷
        session.attribute("attrs", token.attributes);          ❷
 
        return session.id();
    }
```


Fixed code 

```

@Override
    public String create(Request request, Token token) {


		// Invalidate Session
        var session = request.session(false);   ❶
        if (session != null) {                  ❶
            session.invalidate();               ❶
        }
        session = request.session(true);        ❷
        session.attribute("username", token.username);
        session.attribute("expiry", token.expiry);
        session.attribute("attrs", token.attributes);
        return session.id();
    }

```


Cookie Headers to Set

![[Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 2.34.43 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 2.35.10 PM.png]]

Persistent cookies

A cookie with an explicit Expires or Max-Age attribute is known as a persistent cookie and will be permanently stored by the browser until the expiry time is reached, even if the browser is restarted. Cookies without these attributes are known as session cookies

Persistent cookies can be useful during the login process as a “Remember Me” option to avoid the user having to type in their username manually


- `__Secure-` --Enforces that the cookie must be set with the Secure attribute and set by a secure origin.
    
- `__Host-` --Enforces the same protections as `__Secure-`, but also enforces that the cookie is a host-only cookie (has no Domain attribute). This ensures that the cookie cannot be overwritten by a cookie from a sub-domain and is a significant protection against sub-domain hijacking attacks.

### Validating session cookies

❶ Check if a token is present and not expired.

❷ Populate the request subject attribute and any attributes associated with the token.

```
public void validateToken(Request request, Response response) {
    // WARNING: CSRF attack possible
    tokenStore.read(request, null).ifPresent(token -> {      ❶
        if (now().isBefore(token.expiry)) {                  ❶
            request.attribute("subject", token.username);    ❷
            token.attributes.forEach(request::attribute);    ❷
        }
    });
}
```

## Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF, pronounced “sea-surf”) occurs when an attacker makes a cross-origin request to your API and the browser sends cookies along with the request. The request is processed as if it was genuine unless extra checks are made to prevent these requests.

![[Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 7.29.58 PM.png]]

In a CSRF attack, the user first visits the legitimate site and logs in to get a session cookie. Later, they visit a malicious site that makes cross-origin calls to the Natter API. The browser will send the requests and attach the cookies, just like in a genuine request. The malicious script is only blocked from reading the response to cross-origin requests, not stopped from making them.


Prevention

SameSite cookies
	 SameSite cookie will only be sent on requests that originate from the same domain that originally set the cookie. Only the registerable domain is examined, so api.payments.example.com and www .example.com are considered the same site, as they both have the registerable domain of example.com. On the other hand, www .example.org (different suffix) and www .different.com are considered different sites. Unlike an origin, the protocol and port are not considered when making same-site decisions.

SameSite cookies are a good additional protection measure against CSRF attacks, but they are not yet implemented by all browsers and frameworks
For this reason, SameSite cookies should be implemented as a defense-in-depth measure

### Hash-based double-submit cookies

The most effective defense against CSRF attacks is to require that the caller prove that they know the session cookie, or some other unguessable value associated with the session. A common pattern for preventing CSRF in traditional web applications is to generate a random string and store it as an attribute on the session. Whenever the application generates an HTML form, it includes the random token as a hidden field. When the form is submitted, the server checks that the form data contains this hidden field and that the value matches the value stored in the session associated with the cookie. Any form data that is received without the hidden field is rejected. This effectively prevents CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot guess the random fields and so cannot forge a correct request.

Normal pattern with overwrite issue

![[Pasted image 20230927193607.png]]

A double-submit cookie is a cookie that must also be sent as a custom header on every request. As cross-origin scripts are not able to read the value of the cookie, they cannot create the custom header value, so this is an effective defense against CSRF attacks.

 In the hash-based double-submit cookie pattern, the anti-CSRF token is computed as a secure hash of the session cookie. As before, a malicious client is unable to guess the correct value. However, they are now also prevented from overwriting the CSRF cookie because they cannot compute the hash of the session cookie.

Hash pattern which solves overwrite issue.

Timing attacks

A timing attack works by measuring tiny differences in the time it takes a computer to process different inputs to work out some information about a secret value that the attacker does not know. Timing attacks can measure even very small differences in the time it takes to perform a computation, even when carried out over the internet.

`string` `equals` method to compare the hash of the session ID with the anti-CSRF token received in a header. In most programming languages, including Java, string equality is implemented with a loop that terminates as soon as the first non-matching character is found

Prevention 
	Use constant time equality function

### Logout 

❶ Get the token ID from the X-CSRF-Token header.

❷ Revoke the token.

❸ Return a success response.
