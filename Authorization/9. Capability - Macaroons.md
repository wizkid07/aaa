## Summary

- Capability URIs can be used to provide fine-grained access to individual resources via your API. A capability URI combines an identifier for a resource along with a set of permissions to access that resource.
    
- As an alternative to identity-based access control, capabilities avoid ambient authority that can lead to confused deputy attacks and embrace POLA.
    
- There are many ways to form capability URIs that have different trade-offs. The simplest forms encode a random token into the URI path or query parameters. More secure variants encode the token into the fragment or userinfo components but come at a cost of increased complexity for clients.
    
- Tying a capability URI to a user session increases the security of both, because it reduces the risk of capability tokens being stolen and can be used to prevent CSRF attacks. This makes it harder to share capability URIs.
    
- Macaroons allow anybody to restrict a capability by appending caveats that can be cryptographically verified and enforced by an API. Contextual caveats can be appended just before a macaroon is used to secure a token against misuse.
    
- First-party caveats encode simple conditions that can be checked locally by an API, such as restricted the time of day at which a token can be used. Third-party caveats require the client to obtain a discharge macaroon from an external service proving that it satisfies a condition, such that the user is an employee of a certain company or is over 18 years old.


A capability is an unforgeable reference to an object or resource together with a set of permissions to access that resource


- Access to resources is via unforgeable references to those objects that also grant authority to access that resource. In an identity-based system, anybody can attempt to access a resource, but they might be denied access depending on who they are. In a capability-based system, it is impossible to send a request to a resource if you do not have a capability to access it.
    
- Capabilities provide fine-grained access to individual resources, and often support POLA more naturally than identity-based systems. 
    
- The ability to easily share capabilities can make it harder to determine who has access to which resources via your API. 
    
- Some capability-based systems do not support revoking capabilities after they have been granted. When revocation is supported, revoking a widely shared capability may deny access to more people than was intended.

### Capabilities as URIs


A capability URI (or capability URL) is a URI that both identifies a resource and conveys a set of permissions to access that resource. Typically, a capability URI encodes an unguessable token into some part of the URI structure.


- Token-based authentication conveys the identity of a user, from which their permissions can be looked up. A capability instead directly conveys some permissions and does not identify a user at all.

    
- Authentication tokens are designed to be used to access many resources under one API, so are not tied to any one resource. Capabilities are instead directly coupled to a resource and can be used to access only that resource. You use different capabilities to access different resources.
    
- A token will typically be short-lived because it conveys wide-ranging access to a user’s account. A capability, on the other hand, can live longer because it has a much narrower scope for abuse.

A commonly used approach is to encode a random token into the path component of the URI, which is what the Dropbox Chooser API does, returning URIs like the following:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/1/view/8ygmwuqzf1l6x7c/book/graphics/CH08_FIG8.2_RBAC.png

An alternative is to pass the token as a query parameter, in which case the Dropbox URI would look like the following:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/1/view/ 
➥ book/graphics/CH08_FIG8.2_RBAC.png?token=8ygmwuqzf1l6x7c

###  Using capability URIs 

```
    public URI createUri(Request request, String path, String perms,
            Duration expiryDuration) {
 
        var token = new Token(now().plus(expiryDuration), null);     ❷
        token.attributes.put("path", path);                          ❸
        token.attributes.put("perms", perms);                        ❸
        var tokenId = tokenStore.create(request, token);
        var uri = URI.create(request.uri());
        return uri.resolve(path + "?access_token=" + tokenId);       ❹
    }
```

❶ Use an existing SecureTokenStore to generate tokens.

❷ Leave the username null when creating the token.

❸ Encode the resource path and permissions into the token.

❹ Add the token to the URI as a query parameter.

RETURNING CAPABILITY URIS

```
  public JSONObject createSpace(Request request, Response response) {
    var json = new JSONObject(request.body());
    var spaceName = json.getString("name");
    if (spaceName.length() > 255) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("space name too long");
    }
    var owner = json.getString("owner");
    if (!owner.matches("[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{1,29}")) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("invalid username");
    }
    var subject = request.attribute("subject");
    if (!owner.equals(subject)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(
              "owner must match authenticated user");
    }
 
    return database.withTransaction(tx -> {
      var spaceId = database.findUniqueLong(
          "SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR space_id_seq;");
 
      database.updateUnique(
          "INSERT INTO spaces(space_id, name, owner) " +
              "VALUES(?, ?, ?);", spaceId, spaceName, owner);
 
      var expiry = Duration.ofDays(100000);                 ❶
      var uri = capabilityController.createUri(request,     ❷
              "/spaces/" + spaceId, "rwd", expiry);         ❷
 
      response.status(201);
      response.header("Location", uri.toASCIIString());     ❸
 
      return new JSONObject()
              .put("name", spaceName)
              .put("uri", uri);                             ❷
    });
  }
```

VALIDATING CAPABILITIES

❶ Look up the token from the query parameters.

❷ Check that the token is valid and matches the resource path.

❸ Copy the permissions from the token to the request.

```
public void lookupPermissions(Request request, Response response) {
    var tokenId = request.queryParams("access_token");               ❶
    if (tokenId == null) { return; }
 
    tokenStore.read(request, tokenId).ifPresent(token -> {           ❷
        var tokenPath = token.attributes.get("path");                ❷
        if (Objects.equals(tokenPath, request.pathInfo())) {         ❷
            request.attribute("perms",                               ❸
                    token.attributes.get("perms"));                  ❸
        }
    });
}
```

### HATEOAS

HATEOAS, or hypertext as the engine of application state, is a central principle of REST API design that states that a client should not need to have specific knowledge of how to construct URIs to access your API. Instead, the server should provide this information in the form of hyperlinks and form templates.

The aim of HATEOAS is to reduce coupling between the client and server that would otherwise prevent the server from evolving its API over time because it might break assumptions made by clients. But HATEOAS is also a perfect fit for capability URIs because we can return new capability URIs as links in response to using another capability URI, allowing a client to securely navigate from resource to resource without needing to manufacture any URIs by themselves.[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/09.htm#pgfId-1214885)

Example

```
  var uri = capabilityController.createUri(request,
          "/spaces/" + spaceId, "rwd", expiry);
  var messagesUri = capabilityController.createUri(request,     ❶
          "/spaces/" + spaceId + "/messages", "rwd", expiry);   ❶
 
  response.status(201);
  response.header("Location", uri.toASCIIString());
 
  return new JSONObject()
          .put("name", spaceName)
          .put("uri", uri)
          .put("messages", messagesUri);                        ❷
```

❶ Create a new capability URI for the messages.

❷ Return the messages URI as a new field in the response.

```
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -u demo:password \                                     ❶
    -d '{"author":"demo","message":"Hello!"}' \
  'https://localhost:4567/spaces/1/messages?access_token=
➥ u9wu69dl5L8AT9FNe03TM-s4H8M'
```

SUPPORTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCESS

```
      var uri = capabilityController.createUri(request,
              "/spaces/" + spaceId, "rwd", expiry);
      var messagesUri = capabilityController.createUri(request,
              "/spaces/" + spaceId + "/messages", "rwd", expiry);
      var messagesReadWriteUri = capabilityController.createUri(   ❶
              request, "/spaces/" + spaceId + "/messages", "rw",   ❶
              expiry);                                             ❶
      var messagesReadOnlyUri = capabilityController.createUri(    ❶
              request, "/spaces/" + spaceId + "/messages", "r",    ❶
              expiry);                                             ❶
 
      response.status(201);
      response.header("Location", uri.toASCIIString());
 
      return new JSONObject()
              .put("name", spaceName)
              .put("uri", uri)
              .put("messages-rwd", messagesUri)                    ❷
              .put("messages-rw", messagesReadWriteUri)            ❷
              .put("messages-r", messagesReadOnlyUri);             ❷
```

❶ Create additional capability URIs with restricted permissions.

❷ Return the additional capabilities.

You can use the ability to specify different expiry times for links to implement useful functionality. For example, when a user posts a new message, you can return a link that lets them edit it for a few minutes only. A separate link can provide permanent read-only access. This allows users to correct mistakes but not change historical messages.

### Capability URIs for browser-based clients

![[Pasted image 20231003165538.png]]

In the Waterken web-key design for capability URIs, the token is stored in the fragment of the URI, which is never sent to the server. When a browser loads such a URI, it will initially load a static JavaScript page that then extracts the token from the fragment and uses it to make Ajax requests to the API. The JavaScript template can be cached by the browser, avoiding the extra roundtrip for subsequent requests.

### Combining capabilities with identity

For example, in Google Docs ([https://docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/)) you can share documents using capability URIs, but you can also restrict this sharing to only users who have an account in your company’s domain. To access the document, a user needs to both have the link and be signed into a Google account linked to the same company.

There are a few ways to communicate identity in a capability-based system:

- You can associate a username and other identity claims with each capability token. The permissions in the token are still what grants access, but the token additionally authenticates identity claims about the user that can be used for audit logging or additional access checks. The major downside of this approach is that sharing a capability URI lets the recipient impersonate you whenever they make calls to the API using that capability. Nevertheless, this approach can be useful when generating short-lived capabilities that are only intended for a single user. The link sent in a password reset email can be seen as this kind of capability URI because it provides a limited-time capability to reset the password tied to one user’s account.
    
- You could use a traditional authentication mechanism, such as a session cookie, to identify the user in addition to requiring a capability token, as shown in figure 9.4. The cookie would no longer be used to authorize API calls but would instead be used to identify the user for audit logging or for additional checks. Because the cookie is no longer used for access control, it is less sensitive and so can be a long-lived persistent cookie, reducing the need for the user to frequently log in.




![[Pasted image 20231003170024.png]]

When developing a REST API, the second option is often attractive because you can reuse traditional cookie-based authentication technologies such as a centralized OpenID Connect identity provider

### Hardening capability URIs

because an attacker that has a genuine capability to access the API can still use a CSRF attack to make their requests appear to come from a different user. The authority to access the API comes from the attacker’s capability URI, but the identity of the user comes from the cookie. If you keep the existing anti-CSRF token though, clients are required to send three credentials on every request:

- The cookie identifying the user
    
- The anti-CSRF token
    
- The capability token authorizing the specific request
    

This is a bit excessive. At the same time, the capability tokens are vulnerable to being stolen

Solution :

```
public URI createUri(Request request, String path, String perms,
                     Duration expiryDuration) {
    var subject = (String) request.attribute("subject");            ❶
    var token = new Token(now().plus(expiryDuration), subject);     ❷
    token.attributes.put("path", path);
    token.attributes.put("perms", perms);
 
    var tokenId = tokenStore.create(request, token);
 
    var uri = URI.create(request.uri());
    return uri.resolve(path + "?access_token=" + tokenId);
}
```


You can solve both problems by tying the capability tokens to an authenticated user and preventing them being used by anybody else. This removes one of the benefits of capability URIs--that they are easy to share--but improves the overall security:

- If a capability token is stolen, it can’t be used without a valid login cookie for the user. If the cookie is set with the HttpOnly and Secure flags, then it becomes much harder to steal.
    
- You can now remove the separate anti-CSRF token because each capability URI effectively acts as an anti-CSRF token. The cookie can’t be used without the capability and the capability can’t be used without the cookie.

You can then adjust the `lookupPermissions` method in the same file to return no permissions if the username associated with the capability token doesn’t match the authenticated user, as shown in listing 9.10. This ensures that the capability can’t be used without an associated session for the user and that the session cookie can only be used when it matches the capability token, effectively preventing CSRF attacks too.

SHARING ACCESS

Because capability URIs are now tied to individual users, you need a new mechanism to share access to social spaces and individual messages


```
public JSONObject share(Request request, Response response) {
    var json = new JSONObject(request.body());
 
    var capUri = URI.create(json.getString("uri"));               ❶
    var path = capUri.getPath();                                  ❶
    var query = capUri.getQuery();                                ❶
    var tokenId = query.substring(query.indexOf('=') + 1);        ❶
 
    var token = tokenStore.read(request, tokenId).orElseThrow();  ❷
    if (!Objects.equals(token.attributes.get("path"), path)) {    ❷
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("incorrect path");     ❷
    }                                                             ❷
 
    var tokenPerms = token.attributes.get("perms");               ❸
    var perms = json.optString("perms", tokenPerms);              ❸
    if (!tokenPerms.contains(perms)) {                            ❸
        Spark.halt(403);                                          ❸
    }                                                             ❸
    var user = json.getString("user");
    var newToken = new Token(token.expiry, user);                 ❹
    newToken.attributes.put("path", path);                        ❹
    newToken.attributes.put("perms", perms);                      ❹
    var newTokenId = tokenStore.create(request, newToken);        ❹
 
    var uri = URI.create(request.uri());                          ❺
    var newCapUri = uri.resolve(path + "?access_token="           ❺
            + newTokenId);                                        ❺
    return new JSONObject()                                       ❺
            .put("uri", newCapUri);                               ❺
}
```

❶ Parse the original capability URI and extract the token.

❷ Look up the token and check that it matches the URI.

❸ Check that the requested permissions are a subset of the token permissions.

❹ Create and store the new capability token.

❺ Return the requested capability URI.


```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"uri":"/spaces/1/messages?access_token=
➥ 0ed8-IohfPQUX486d0kr03W8Ec8", "user":"demo2", "perms":"r"}' \
  https://localhost:4567/share
{"uri":"/spaces/1/messages?access_token=
➥ 1YQqZdNAIce5AB_Z8J7ClMrnx68"}
```

The new capability URI in the response can only be used by the demo2 user and provides only read permission on the space. You can use this facility to build resource sharing for your APIs. For example, if a user directly shares a capability URI of their own with another user, rather than denying access completely you could allow them to request access. This is what happens in Google Docs if you follow a link to a document that you don’t have access to. The owner of the document can then approve access. In Google Docs this is done by adding an entry to an access control list (chapter 3) associated with each document, but with capabilities, the owner could generate a capability URI instead that is then emailed to the recipient.

## Macaroons: Tokens with caveats

Sometimes the granularity of capability URIs doesn’t match up with how users want to share resources. For example, suppose that you want to share read-only access to a snapshot of the conversations since yesterday in a social space. It’s unlikely that the API will always supply a capability URI that exactly matches the user’s wishes; the `createSpace` action already returns four URIs, and none of them quite fit the bill.

A macaroon is a type of cryptographic token that can be used to represent capabilities and other authorization grants. Anybody can append new caveats to a macaroon that restrict how it can be used.

To address our example, the user could append the following caveats to their capability to create a new capability that allows only read access to messages since lunchtime yesterday:

```
method = GET
since >= 2019-10-12T12:00:00Z
```

![[Pasted image 20231003173558.png]]

 To append a new caveat to a macaroon, you use the old HMAC tag as the key to authenticate the new caveat. You then throw away the old tag and append the new caveat and tag. Because nobody can reverse HMAC to calculate the old tag, they cannot remove the caveat.
 
When the macaroon is presented back to the API, it can use the original HMAC key to reconstruct the original tag and all the caveat tags and check if it comes up with the same signature value at the end of the chain of caveats. Listing 9.12 shows an example of how to verify an HMAC chain just like that used by macaroons.

### Contextual caveats

A contextual caveat is a caveat that is added by a client just before use. Contextual caveats allow the authority of a token to be restricted before sending it over an insecure channel or to an untrusted API, limiting the damage that might occur if the token is stolen.

Macaroons can be used with any token-based authentication and even OAuth2 access tokens if your authorization server supports them.[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/09.htm#pgfId-1215227) On the other hand, there is no formal specification of macaroons and awareness and adoption of the format is still quite limited, so they are not as widely supported as JWTs (chapter 6).


### First-party caveats

The simplest caveats are first-party caveats, which can be verified by the API purely based on the API request and the current environment. These caveats are represented as strings and there is no standard format. The only commonly implemented first-party caveat is to set an expiry time for the macaroon using the syntax:

time < 2019-10-12T12:00:00Z

You can think of this caveat as being like the expiry (exp) claim in a JWT (chapter 6). The tokens issued by the Natter API already have an expiry time, but a client might want to create a copy of their token with a more restricted expiry time as discussed in section 9.3.1 on contextual caveats.
### Third-party caveats

First-party caveats provide considerable flexibility and security improvements over traditional tokens on their own, but macaroons also allow third-party caveats that are verified by an external service. Rather than the API verifying a third-party caveat directly, the client instead must contact the third-party service itself and obtain a discharge macaroon that proves that the condition is satisfied. The two macaroons are cryptographically tied together so that the API can verify that the condition is satisfied without talking directly to the third-party service.
