## Summary

- Scoped tokens allow clients to be given access to some parts of your API but not others, allowing users to delegate limited access to third-party apps and services.
    
- The OAuth2 standard provides a framework for third-party clients to register with your API and negotiate access with user consent.
    
- All user-facing API clients should use the authorization code grant with PKCE to obtain access tokens, whether they are traditional web apps, SPAs, mobile apps, or desktop apps. The implicit grant should no longer be used.
    
- The standard token introspection endpoint can be used to validate an access token, or JWT-based access tokens can be used to reduce network roundtrips. Refresh tokens can be used to keep token lifetimes short without disrupting the user experience.
    
- The OpenID Connect standard builds on top of OAuth2, providing a comprehensive framework for offloading user authentication to a dedicated service. ID tokens can be used for user identification but should be avoided for access control.


## Scoped tokens

A scoped token limits the operations that can be performed with that token. The set of operations that are allowed is known as the scope of the token. The scope of a token is specified by one or more scope labels, which are often referred to collectively as scopes.

Example: Github's PAT

### Approach One - Storing scopes as token attributes

- First, check if the HTTP method of the request matches the method that this rule is for, so that you don’t apply a scope for a POST request to a DELETE request or vice versa. This is needed because Spark’s filters are matched only by the path and not the request method.
    
- You can then look up the scope associated with the token that authorized the current request from the scope attribute of the request. This works because the token validation code you wrote in chapter 4 copies any attributes from the token into the request, so the scope attribute will be copied across too.
    
- If there is no scope attribute, then the user directly authenticated the request with Basic authentication. In this case, you can skip the scope check and let the request proceed. Any client with access to the user’s password would be able to issue themselves a token with any scope.
    
- Finally, you can verify that the scope of the token matches the required scope for this request, and if it doesn’t, then you should return a 403 Forbidden error. The Bearer authentication scheme has a dedicated error code `insufficient_` `scope` to indicate that the caller needs a token with a different scope, so you can indicate that in the WWW-Authenticate header.

```

public Filter requireScope(String method, String requiredScope) {
    return (request, response) -> {
        if (!method.equalsIgnoreCase(request.requestMethod()))    ❶
            return;                                               ❶
        var tokenScope = request.<String>attribute("scope");      ❷
        if (tokenScope == null) return;                           ❷
        if (!Set.of(tokenScope.split(" "))                        ❸
                .contains(requiredScope)) {                       ❸
            response.header("WWW-Authenticate",                   ❸
                    "Bearer error=\"insufficient_scope\"," +      ❸
                            "scope=\"" + requiredScope + "\"");   ❸
            halt(403);                                            ❸
        }
    };
}
```

❶ If the HTTP method doesn’t match, then ignore this rule.

❷ If the token is unscoped, then allow all operations.

❸ If the token scope doesn’t contain the required scope, then return a 403 Forbidden response.


**GOTCHAs**

To avoid privilege escalation, you should require a specific scope to call the login endpoint, because this can be used to obtain a token with any scope, effectively bypassing the scope checks

On the other hand, revoking a token by calling the logout endpoint should not require any scope.

### The difference between scopes and permissions

Permissions are typically granted by a central authority that owns the API being accessed. A user does not get to choose or change their own permissions. Scopes allow a user to delegate part of their authority to a third-party app, restricting how much access they grant using scopes.

![[Pasted image 20230929135102.png]]


With mandatory access control (MAC), user permissions are set and enforced by a central authority and cannot be granted by users themselves. With discretionary access control (DAC), users can delegate some of their permissions to other users. OAuth2 allows discretionary access control, also known as delegated authorization.


Permission - MAC - Mandatory Access Control

Scopes - DAC  - Discretionary Access Control

The delegated authorization in OAuth is about users delegating their authority to clients, such as mobile apps. The User Managed Access (UMA) extension of OAuth2 allows users to delegate access to other users.

Types of scope 

1. Fine grained
2. Coarse grained

Should be decided based on business requirement

General Guidelines

1. System APIs - Coarse Grained
2. User Info - Fine Grained

Google Cloud Platform OAuth scopes are very coarse-grained for system APIs such as database access or key management. For APIs that process user data, such as the Fitness API, many more scopes are defined, allowing users greater control over what they share with third-party apps and services.

## OAuth2

An access token is a token issued by an OAuth2 authorization server to allow a client to access an API.

OAuth uses specific terms to refer to the four entities shown in figure 7.4, based on the role they play in the interaction:

- The authorization server (AS) authenticates the user and issues tokens to clients.
    
- The user is known as the resource owner (RO), because it’s typically their resources (documents, photos, and so on) that the third-party app is trying to access. This term is not always accurate, but it has stuck now.
    
- The third-party app or service is known as the client.
    
- The API that hosts the user’s resources is known as the resource server (RS).

![[Pasted image 20230929192931.png]]

To access an API using OAuth2, an app must first obtain an access token from the Authorization Server (AS). The app tells the AS what scope of access it requires. The AS verifies that the user consents to this access and issues an access token to the app. The app can then use the access token to access the API on the user’s behalf.

There are two different types of clients:

- Public clients are applications that run entirely within a user’s own device, such as a mobile app or JavaScript client running in a browser. The client is completely under the user’s control.
    
- Confidential clients run in a protected web server or other secure location that is not under a user’s direct control.

A confidential client uses client credentials to authenticate to the AS. Usually, this is a long random password known as a client secret, but more secure forms of authentication can be used, including JWTs and TLS client certificates.

- The Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) grant is the simplest, in which the user supplies their username and password to the client, which then sends them directly to the AS to obtain an access token with any scope it wants. This is almost identical to the token login endpoint you developed in previous chapters and is not recommended for third-party clients because the user directly shares their password with the app--the very thing you were trying to avoid!

### Discovering OAuth2 endpoints

A conforming AS is required to publish a JSON document under the path /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server under the root of its web server.[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/07.htm#pgfId-1195085) This JSON document contains the locations of the token and authorization endpoints and other settings. For example, if your AS is hosted as https:/ /as.example.com:8443, then a GET request to https:/ /as.example.com:8443/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server returns a JSON document like the following:

{
  "authorization_endpoint": 
    "http://openam.example.com:8080/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": 
    "http://openam.example.com:8080/oauth2/access_token",
  ...
}

Because the client will send credentials and access tokens to many of these endpoints, it’s critical that they are discovered from a trustworthy source. Only retrieve the discovery document over HTTPS from a trusted URL.

## The Authorization Code grant

- Server-side clients, such as traditional web applications or other APIs. A server-side application should be a confidential client with credentials to authenticate to the AS.
    
- Client-side JavaScript applications that run in the browser, such as single-page apps. A client-side application is always a public client because it has no secure place to store a client secret.
    
- Mobile, desktop, and command-line applications. As for client-side applications, these should be public clients, because any secret embedded into the application can be extracted by a user.

![[Pasted image 20231002132627.png]]


In the Authorization Code grant, the client first redirects the user’s web browser to the authorization endpoint for the AS. The AS then authenticates the user and asks for consent to grant access to the application. If approved, then the AS redirects the web browser to a URI controlled by the client, including an authorization code. The client can then call the AS token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token to use to access the API on the user’s behalf.

An open redirect vulnerability is when a server can be tricked into redirecting a web browser to a URI under the attacker’s control. This can be used for phishing because it initially looks like the user is going to a trusted site, only to be redirected to the attacker. You should require all redirect URIs to be pre-registered by trusted clients rather than redirecting to any URI provided in a request.

Example 

```
Request

POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic dGVzdDpwYXNzd29yZA==            ❶
 
grant_type=authorization_code&                       ❷
code=kdYfMS7H3sOO5y_sKhpdV6NFfik&                    ❷
redirect_uri=https://client.example.net/callback     ❸


Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
{
  "access_token":"QdT8POxT2SReqKNtcRDicEgIgkk",    ❶
  "scope":"post_message read_messages",            ❷
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":3599
}
```

###  Redirect URIs for different types of clients

web application, it’s simple to create a dedicated endpoint to use for the redirect URI to receive the authorization code. For a single-page app, the redirect URI should be the URI of the app from which client-side JavaScript can then extract the authorization code and make a CORS request to the token endpoint.

For mobile applications, there are two primary options:

- The application can register a private-use URI scheme with the mobile operating system, such as `myapp:/ /callback`. When the AS redirects to `myapp:/ /` `callback?code=...` in the system web browser, the operating system will launch the native app and pass it the callback URI. The native application can then extract the authorization code from this URI and call the token endpoint.
    
- An alternative is to register a portion of the path on the web domain of the app producer. For example, your app could register with the operating system that it will handle all requests to `https:/ /example.com/app/callback`. When the AS redirects to this HTTPS endpoint, the mobile operating system will launch the native app just as for a private-use URI scheme. Android calls this an App Link ([https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/)), while on iOS they are known as Universal Links ([https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/)).

### Hardening code exchange with PKCE

Must be done for all public clients

The way PKCE works for a client is quite simple. Before the client redirects the user to the authorization endpoint, it generates another random value, known as the PKCE code verifier. This value should be generated with high entropy, such as a 32-byte value from a `SecureRandom` object in Java; the PKCE standard requires that the encoded value is at least 43 characters long and a maximum of 128 characters from a restricted set of characters. The client stores the code verifier locally, alongside the state parameter. Rather than sending this value directly to the AS, the client first hashes[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/07.htm#pgfId-1195230) it using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function to create a code challenge (listing 7.4). The client then adds the code challenge as another query parameter when redirecting to the authorization endpoint.

### Refresh tokens

A client can use a refresh token to obtain a fresh access token when the original one expires. This allows an AS to issue short-lived access tokens without clients having to ask the user for a new token every time it expires.

By issuing a refresh token, the AS can limit the lifetime of access tokens. This has a minor security benefit because if an access token is stolen, then it can only be used for a short period of time. But in practice, a lot of damage could be done even in a short space of time by an automated attack, such as the Facebook attack discussed in chapter 6 ([https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/security-update/)). The primary benefit of refresh tokens is to allow the use of stateless access tokens such as JWTs. If the access token is short-lived, then the client is forced to periodically refresh the token at the AS, providing an opportunity for the token to be revoked without the AS maintaining a large blocklist. The complexity of revocation is effectively pushed to the client, which must now handle periodically refreshing its access tokens.

access tokens are generally bearer tokens and considered stateless. You send them to the resource server (the server hosting whatever API), and they will not care who you are.

However, a refresh token is NOT sent to a resource server. It's sent to an authorization server, and the refresh token generally has more security implementations to prevent abuse. As per [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) spec:

> (G) The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the refresh token. The client authentication requirements are based on the client type and on the authorization server policies.
> 
> (H) The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the refresh token, and if valid, issues a new access token (and, optionally, a new refresh token).

Generally, this requires a client ID and client secret to be sent for authentication to enforce refresh token / client binding. But, it goes even one step further

## Validating an access token

### Token introspection

To validate an access token using token introspection, you simply make a POST request to the introspection endpoint of the AS, passing in the access token as a parameter

Because the token is untrusted before the call, you should first validate it to ensure that it conforms to the allowed syntax for access tokens

The standard doesn’t specify a maximum size for access tokens, but you should enforce a limit of around 1KB or less, which should be enough for most token formats (if the access token is a JWT, it could get quite large and you may need to increase that limit).

To avoid making an HTTP call every time a client uses an access token with your API, you can cache the response for a short period of time, indexed by the token. The longer you cache the response, the longer it may take your API to find out that a token has been revoked, so you should balance performance against security based on your threat model.


![[Pasted image 20231002195258.png]]


You should make sure that the AS and the API have the same users and that the AS communicates the username to the API in the `sub` or `username` fields from the introspection response. Otherwise, the API may not be able to match the username returned from token introspection to entries in its access control lists (chapter 3). In many corporate environments, the users will not be stored in a local database but instead in a shared LDAP directory that is maintained by a company’s IT department that both the AS and the API have access to, as shown in figure 7.7.

### Token revocation

the client makes a POST request to a revocation endpoint at the AS, passing in the token in the request body, as shown in listing 7.9. The client should include its client credentials to authenticate the request. Only an HTTP status code is returned, so there is no need to parse the response body.

###  JWT access tokens

To validate a JWT-based access token, the API needs to first authenticate the JWT using a cryptographic key.

 In chapter 6, you used symmetric HMAC or authenticated encryption algorithms in which the same key is used to both create and verify messages. This means that any party that can verify a JWT is also able to create one that will be trusted by all other parties. Although this is suitable when the API and AS exist within the same trust boundary, it becomes a security risk when the APIs are in different trust boundaries.
 
 if the AS is in a different datacenter to the API, the key must now be shared between those two datacenters. If there are many APIs that need access to the shared key, then the security risk increases even further because an attacker that compromises any API can then create access tokens that will be accepted by all of them.
 
the AS can switch to public key cryptography using digital signatures


![[Pasted image 20231002195532.png]]

RETRIEVING THE PUBLIC KEY

The API can be directly configured with the public key of the AS. For example, you could create a keystore that contains the public key, which the API can read when it first starts up. Although this will work, it has some disadvantages:

The API can periodically fetch the JWK Set from an HTTPS URI provided by the AS. The API can trust the public keys in the JWK Set because they were retrieved over HTTPS from a trusted URI, and that HTTPS connection was authenticated using the server certificate presented during the TLS handshake.

Many JWT libraries have built-in support for retrieving keys from a JWK Set over HTTPS, including periodically refreshing them. For example, the Nimbus JWT library that you used in chapter 6 supports retrieving keys from a JWK Set URI using the `RemoteJWKSet` class:

var jwkSetUri = URI.create("https://as.example.com:8443/jwks_uri");
var jwkSet = new RemoteJWKSet(jwkSetUri);

You can then verify that the other claims are correct. You should check that the JWT was issued by the AS by validating the `iss` claim, and that the access token is meant for this API by ensuring that an identifier for the API appears in the audience (`aud`) claim

Of these choices, the best is `EdDSA`, based on the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037)). EdDSA signatures are fast to produce and verify, produce compact signatures, and are designed to be implemented securely against side-channel attacks. Not all JWT libraries or AS software supports EdDSA signatures yet

### Encrypted JWT access tokens

![[Pasted image 20231002195951.png]]

### Letting the AS decrypt the tokens

An alternative to using public key signing and encryption would be for the AS to encrypt access tokens with a symmetric authenticated encryption algorithm, such as the ones you learned about in chapter 6. Rather than sharing this symmetric key with every API, they instead call the token introspection endpoint to validate the token rather than verifying it locally. Because the AS does not need to perform a database lookup to validate the token, it may be easier to horizontally scale the AS in this case by adding more servers to handle increased traffic.

This pattern allows the format of access tokens to change over time because only the AS validates tokens. In software engineering terms, the choice of token format is encapsulated by the AS and hidden from resource servers, while with public key signed JWTs, each API knows how to validate tokens, making it much harder to change the representation later.

## Single sign-on

![[Pasted image 20231002200123.png]]

## OpenID Connect

OAuth can provide basic SSO functionality, but the primary focus is on delegated third-party access to APIs rather than user identity or session management. The OpenID Connect (OIDC) suite of standards ([https://openid.net/developers/specs/](https://openid.net/developers/specs/)) extend OAuth2 with several features:

- A standard way to retrieve identity information about a user, such as their name, email address, postal address, and telephone number. The client can access a UserInfo endpoint to retrieve identity claims as JSON using an OAuth2 access token with standard OIDC scopes.
    
- A way for the client to request that the user is authenticated even if they have an existing session, and to ask for them to be authenticated in a particular way, such as with two-factor authentication. While obtaining an OAuth2 access token may involve user authentication, it’s not guaranteed that the user was even present when the token was issued or how recently they logged in. OAuth2 is primarily a delegated access protocol, whereas OIDC provides a full authentication protocol. If the client needs to positively authenticate a user, then OIDC should be used.
    
- Extensions for session management and logout, allowing clients to be notified when a user logs out of their session at the AS, enabling the user to log out of all clients at once (known as single logout).

### ID tokens

An ID token is a signed and optionally encrypted JWT that contains identity and authentication claims about a user.

Never use ID tokens for access control for third-party clients. Use access tokens for access and ID tokens for identity. ID tokens are like usernames; access tokens are like passwords.
