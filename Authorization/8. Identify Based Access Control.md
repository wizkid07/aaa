## Summary

- Users can be collected into groups on an organisational level to make them easier to administer. LDAP has built-in support for managing user groups.
    
- RBAC collects related sets of permissions on objects into roles which can then be assigned to users or groups and later revoked. Role assignments may be either static or dynamic.
    
- Roles are often specific to an API, while groups are more often defined statically for a whole organization.
    
- ABAC evaluates access control decisions dynamically based on attributes of the subject, the resource they are accessing, the action they are attempting to perform, and the environment or context in which the request occurs (such as the time or location).
    
- ABAC access control decisions can be centralized using a policy engine. The XACML standard defines a common model for ABAC architecture, with separate components for policy decisions (PDP), policy information (PIP), policy administration (PAP), and policy enforcement (PEP).

 If you have a million users and a million objects, then in the worst case you could end up with a billion ACL entries listing the individual permissions of each user for each object. Though that approach can work with fewer users, it becomes more of a problem as the user base grows.

Identity-based access control (IBAC) determines what you can do based on who you are. The user performing an API request is first authenticated and then a check is performed to see if that user is authorized to perform the requested action.

## Users and groups

![[Pasted image 20231002205847.png]]

Groups are added as a new type of subject. Permissions can then be assigned to individual users or to groups. A user can be a member of many groups and each group can have many members.

Implementation

The implementation of simple groups is straightforward. Currently in the Natter API you have written, there is a `users` table and a `permissions` table that acts as an ACL linking users to permissions within a space. To add groups, you could first add a new table to indicate which users are members of which groups:

```
CREATE TABLE group_members(
    group_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    user_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id));
CREATE INDEX group_member_user_idx ON group_members(user_id);

```

When the user authenticates, you can then look up the groups that user is a member of and add them as an additional request attribute that can be viewed by other processes. Listing 8.1 shows how groups could be looked up in the `authenticate()` method in `UserController` after the user has successfully authenticated.

Flow,

❶ Look up the groups the user is a member of.

❷ Build a dynamic query to check permissions for the user.

❸ Include any groups in the query.

❹ Fail if none of the permissions for the user or groups allow this action.

During authentication fetch details needed for access control and set in user context.

As far as possible, you should ensure that all user attributes required for access control decisions are collected during the authentication step, and then decide if the request is authorized using these attributes. As a concrete example of how violating this layering can cause problems, consider what would happen if you changed your API to use an external user store such as LDAP (discussed in the next section) or an OpenID Connect identity provider (chapter 7). In these cases, the groups that a user is a member of are likely to be returned as additional attributes during authentication (such as in the ID token JWT) rather than exist in the API’s own database.

### LDAP groups

In many large organizations, including most companies, users are managed centrally in an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory. LDAP is designed for storing user information and has built-in support for groups

A directory server (more technically referred to as a Directory Server Agent, a Directory System Agent, or a DSA) is a type of network database that stores information represented as trees of entries. This is different from a relational database, which uses tables comprised of rows and columns, so directory servers may be considered a type of NoSQL database (even though directory servers have been around a lot longer than the term NoSQL has).

## Role-based access control

![[Pasted image 20231002223805.png]]

 In RBAC, permissions are assigned to roles rather than directly to users. Users are then assigned to roles, depending on their required level of access.

In principle, everything that you can accomplish with RBAC could be accomplished with groups, but in practice there are several differences in how they are used, including the following:

- Groups are used primarily to organize users, while roles are mainly used as a way to organize permissions.
    
- groups tend to be assigned centrally, whereas roles tend to be specific to a particular application or API. 
    
- Group-based systems often allow permissions to be assigned to individual users, but RBAC systems typically don’t allow that. This restriction can dramatically simplify the process of reviewing who has access to what.
    
- RBAC systems split the definition and assigning of permissions to roles from the assignment of users to those roles. It is much less error-prone to assign a user to a role than to work out which permissions each role should have, so this is a useful separation of duties that improves security.
    
- Roles may have a dynamic element. For example, some military and other environments have the concept of a duty officer, who has particular privileges and responsibilities only during their shift. When the shift ends, they hand over to the next duty officer, who takes on that role.

RBAC is almost always used as a form of mandatory access control, with roles being described and assigned by whoever controls the systems that are being accessed

### Mapping roles to permissions

❶ Each role grants a set of permissions.

❷ Define roles for Natter social spaces.

❸ Because the roles are fixed, the API is granted read-only access.

### Static roles

```
CREATE TABLE user_roles(                                                ❶
    space_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES spaces(space_id),                  ❶
    user_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),             ❶
    role_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL REFERENCES role_permissions(role_id),  ❶
    PRIMARY KEY (space_id, user_id)                                     ❷
);
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON user_roles TO natter_api_user;

```

```
public JSONObject addMember(Request request, Response response) {
  var json = new JSONObject(request.body());
  var spaceId = Long.parseLong(request.params(":spaceId"));
  var userToAdd = json.getString("username");
  var role = json.optString("role", "member");                     ❶
 
  if (!DEFINED_ROLES.contains(role)) {                             ❶
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("invalid role");            ❶
  }
 
  database.updateUnique(
          "INSERT INTO user_roles(space_id, user_id, role_id)" +   ❷
                  " VALUES(?, ?, ?)", spaceId, userToAdd, role);   ❷
 
  response.status(200);
  return new JSONObject()
          .put("username", userToAdd)
          .put("role", role);                                      ❸
}

```

❶ Extract the role from the input and validate it.

❷ Insert the new role assignment for this space.

❸ Return the role in the response.


### Determining user roles

The final step of the puzzle is to determine which roles a user has when they make a request to the API and the permissions that each role allows. This can be found by looking up the user in the `user_roles` table to discover their role for a given space, and then looking up the permissions assigned to that role in the `role_permissions` table

JOIN Query

```
SELECT rp.perms
  FROM role_permissions rp
  JOIN user_roles ur
    ON ur.role_id = rp.role_id
 WHERE ur.space_id = ? AND ur.user_id = ?
```

Searching the database for roles and permissions can be expensive, but the current implementation will repeat this work every time the `requirePermission` filter is called, which could be several times while processing a request. To avoid this issue and simplify the logic, you can extract the permission look up into a separate filter that runs before any permission checks and stores the permissions in a request attribute


❶ Determine user permissions by mapping user to role to permissions.

❷ Store permissions in a request attribute.

❸ Retrieve permissions from the request before checking.

### Dynamic roles

Though static role assignments are the most common, some RBAC systems allow more dynamic queries to determine which roles a user should have. For example, a call center worker might be granted a role that allows them access to customer records so that they can respond to customer support queries. To reduce the risk of misuse, the system could be configured to grant the worker this role only during their contracted working hours, perhaps based on their shift times. Outside of these times the user would not be granted the role, and so would be denied access to customer records if they tried to access them.

Although dynamic role assignments have been implemented in several systems, there is no clear standard for how to build dynamic roles

## Attribute-based access control

To handle dynamic access control decisions, an alternative to RBAC has been developed known as ABAC: attribute-based access control. In ABAC, access control decisions are made dynamically for each API request using collections of attributes grouped into four categories:

- Attributes about the subject; that is, the user making the request. This could include their username, any groups they belong to, how they were authenticated, when they last authenticated, and so on.
    
- Attributes about the resource or object being accessed, such as the URI of the resource or a security label (TOP SECRET, for example).
    
- Attributes about the action the user is trying to perform, such as the HTTP method.
    
- Attributes about the environment or context in which the operation is taking place. This might include the local time of day, or the location of the user performing the action.
![[Pasted image 20231003001950.png]]

❶ Gather relevant attributes and group them into categories.

❷ Check whether the request is permitted.

❸ If not, halt with a 403 Forbidden error.

❹ The Decision class will be described next.


### Implementing ABAC decisions

The safest option is to default to denying requests unless explicitly permitted by some access rule, and to give deny decisions priority over permit decisions.

it’s often clearer if the policy is expressed in the form of rules or domain-specific language (DSL) explicitly designed to express access control decisions. In this section you’ll implement a simple ABAC decision engine using the Drools ([https://drools.org](https://drools.org/)) business rules engine from Red Hat. Drools can be used to write all kinds of business rules and provides a convenient syntax for authoring access control rules.

Drools is part of a larger suite of tools marketed under the banner “Knowledge is Everything,” so many classes and packages used in Drools include the `kie` abbreviation in their names.

Example

```
❶ Load all rules found in the classpath.

❷ Start a new Drools session.

❸ Create a Decision object and set it as a global variable named “decision.”

❹ Insert facts for each category of attributes.

❺ Run the rule engine to see which rules match the request and check the decision.

❻ Dispose of the session when finished.

### Policy agents and API gateways

 A policy agent can plug into an application server or reverse proxy to enforce ABAC policies. Some API gateways can also enforce policy decisions as standalone components.

![[Pasted image 20231003002711.png]]

### Distributed policy enforcement and XACML

![[Pasted image 20231003002856.png]]

- A Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) acts like a policy agent to intercept requests to an API and reject any requests that are denied by policy.
    
- The PEP talks to a Policy Decision Point (PDP) to determine if a request should be allowed. The PDP contains a policy engine like those you’ve seen already in this chapter.
    
- A Policy Information Point (PIP) is responsible for retrieving and caching values of relevant attributes from different data sources. These might be local databases or remote services such as an OIDC UserInfo endpoint (see chapter 7).
    
- A Policy Administration Point (PAP) provides an interface for administrators to define and manage policies.

To maximize the benefits of ABAC while limiting the potential for mistakes, consider adopting the following best practices:

- Layer ABAC over a simpler access control technology such as RBAC. This provides a defense-in-depth strategy so that a mistake in the ABAC rules doesn’t result in a total loss of security.
    
- Implement automated testing of your API endpoints so that you are alerted quickly if a policy change results in access being granted to unintended parties.
    
- Ensure access control policies are maintained in a version control system so that they can be easily rolled back if necessary. Ensure proper review of all policy changes.
    
- Consider which aspects of policy should be centralized and which should be left up to individual APIs or local policy agents. Though it can be tempting to centralize everything, this can introduce a layer of bureaucracy that can make it harder to make changes. In the worst case, this can violate the principle of least privilege because overly broad policies are left in place due to the overhead of changing them.
    
- Measure the performance overhead of ABAC policy evaluation early and often.
