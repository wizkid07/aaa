1. General Data Protection Regulation -  GDPR
	1. The law requires companies to report any data breaches within 72 hours and violations of the law can result in fines of up to €20 million


1. Information security (InfoSec) is concerned with the protection of information over its full life cycle from creation, storage, transmission, backup, and eventual destruction.
    
2. Network security deals with both the protection of data flowing over a network and prevention of unauthorized access to the network itself.
    
3. Application security (AppSec) ensures that software systems are designed and built to withstand attacks and misuse.


API security lies at the intersection of three security areas: information security, network security, and application security

The basic infrastructure used to protect an API on the internet, including firewalls, load-balancers, and reverse proxies

- Use of secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to protect data transmitted to or from your API


Elements of API Security

Assets - Things to be protected

Security Goals

Confidentiality --Ensuring information can only be read by its intended audience

Integrity --Preventing unauthorised creation, modification, or destruction of information

Availability --Ensuring that the legitimate users of an API can access it when they need to and are not prevented from doing so

Environment and Threat modeling

A threat is an event or set of circumstances that defeats the security goals of your API. For example, an attacker stealing names and address details from your customer database is a threat to confidentiality.

Threat modeling is the process of systematically identifying threats to a software system so that they can be recorded, tracked, and mitigated.

1. Draw a system diagram showing the main logical components of your API.
    
2. Identify trust boundaries between parts of the system. Everything within a trust boundary is controlled and managed by the same owner, such as a private datacenter or a set of processes running under a single operating system user.
    
3. Draw arrows to show how data flows between the various parts of the system.
    
4. Examine each component and data flow in the system and try to identify threats that might undermine your security goals in each case. Pay particular attention to flows that cross trust boundaries. (See the next section for how to do this.)
    
5. Record threats to ensure they are tracked and managed

One very popular methodology is known by the acronym STRIDE, which stands for:

- Spoofing--Pretending to be somebody else
    
- Tampering--Altering data, messages, or settings you’re not supposed to alter
    
- Repudiation--Denying that you did something that you really did do
    
- Information disclosure--Revealing information that should be kept private
    
- Denial of service--Preventing others from accessing information and services
    
- Elevation of privilege--Gaining access to functionality you’re not supposed to have access to

SECURITY MECHANISMS

Threats can be countered by applying security mechanisms that ensure that particular security goals are met. In this section we will run through the most common security mechanisms that you will generally find in every well-designed API:

- Encryption ensures that data can’t be read by unauthorized parties, either when it is being transmitted from the API to a client or at rest in a database or filesystem. Modern encryption also ensures that data can’t be modified by an attacker.
    
- Authentication is the process of ensuring that your users and clients are who they say they are.
    
- Access control (also known as authorization) is the process of ensuring that every request made to your API is appropriately authorized.
    
- Audit logging is used to ensure that all operations are recorded to allow accountability and proper monitoring of the API.
    
- Rate-limiting is used to prevent any one user (or group of users) using all of the resources and preventing access for legitimate users.

### Encryption

- Requests and responses to an API may be at risk as they travel over networks, such as the internet. Encrypting data in transit is used to protect against these threats.
    
- Data may be at risk from people with access to the disk storage that is used for persistence. Encrypting data at rest is used to protect against these threats

### Identification and authentication

- You want to record which users performed what actions to ensure accountability.
    
- You may need to know who a user is to decide what they can do, to enforce confidentiality and integrity goals.
    
- You may want to only process authenticated requests to avoid anonymous DoS attacks that compromise availability.

### Access control and authorization

- Identity-based access control first identifies the user and then determines what they can do based on who they are. A user can try to access any resource but may be denied access based on access control rules.
    
- Capability-based access control uses special tokens or keys known as capabilities to access an API. The capability itself says what operations the bearer can perform rather than who the user is. A capability both names a resource and describes the permissions on it, so a user is not able to access any resource that they do not have a capability for

### Audit logging


An audit log is a record of every operation performed using your API. The purpose of an audit log is to ensure accountability. It can be used after a security breach as part of a forensic investigation to find out what went wrong, but also analyzed in real-time by log analysis tools to identity attacks in progress and other suspicious behavior. A good audit log can be used to answer the following kinds of questions:

- Who performed the action and what client did they use?
    
- When was the request received?
    
- What kind of request was it, such as a read or modify operation?
    
- What resource was being accessed?
    
- Was the request successful? If not, why?
    
- What other requests did they make around the same time?

Personally identifiable information, or PII, is any information that relates to an individual person and can help to identify that person. For example, their name or address, or their date and place of birth. Many countries have data protection laws like the GDPR, which strictly control how PII may be stored and used.

### Rate-limiting

rate-limiting is often performed in highly optimized code running in an off-the-shelf load balancer, reverse proxy, or API gateway that can sit in front of your API to protect it from DoS attacks rather than having to add this code to each API. Some commercial companies offer DoS protection as a service

Throttling is a process by which a client’s requests are slowed down without disconnecting the client completely. Throttling can be achieved either by queueing requests for later processing, or else by responding to the requests with a status code telling the client to slow down. If the client doesn’t slow down, then subsequent requests are rejected

When a distributed DoS is in progress, malicious requests will be coming from many different machines on different IP addresses. It is therefore important to be able to apply rate-limiting to a whole group of clients rather than individually
