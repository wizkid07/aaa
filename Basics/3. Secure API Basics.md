## Summary

- Use threat-modelling with STRIDE to identify threats to your API. Select appropriate security controls for each type of threat.
    
- Apply rate-limiting to mitigate DoS attacks. Rate limits are best enforced in a load balancer or reverse proxy but can also be applied per-server for defense in depth.
    
- Enable HTTPS for all API communications to ensure confidentiality and integrity of requests and responses. Add HSTS headers to tell web browser clients to always use HTTPS.
    
- Use authentication to identify users and prevent spoofing attacks. Use a secure password-hashing scheme like Scrypt to store user passwords.
    
- All significant operations on the system should be recorded in an audit log, including details of who performed the action, when, and whether it was successful.
    
- Enforce access control after authentication. ACLs are a simple approach to enforcing permissions.
    
- Avoid privilege escalation attacks by considering carefully which users can grant permissions to other users.

## Notes

Only rate-limiting and access control directly reject requests. A failure in authentication does not immediately cause a request to fail, but a later access control decision may reject a request if it is not authenticated. This is important because we want to ensure that even failed requests are logged, which they would not be if the authentication process immediately rejected unauthenticated requests.


## Rate-limiting for availability - DOS

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to prevent legitimate users from accessing your API. This can include physical attacks, such as unplugging network cables, but more often involves generating large amounts of traffic to overwhelm your servers. A distributed DoS (DDoS) attack uses many machines across the internet to generate traffic, making it harder to block than a single bad client.

Never allow unauthenticated requests to consume significant resources on your server.

DNS amplification attack - prevented using a firewall - Network-level layer
	 In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends the same DNS query to many DNS servers, spoofing their IP address to look like the request came from the victim. By carefully choosing the DNS query, the server can be tricked into replying with much more data than was in the original query, flooding the victim with traffic.

Rate-limiting should be the very first security decision made

You should implement rate-limiting as early as possible, ideally at a load balancer or reverse proxy before requests even reach your API servers

Even if you enforce rate-limiting at a proxy server, it is good security practice to also enforce rate limits in each server so that if the proxy server misbehaves or is misconfigured, it is still difficult to bring down the individual servers. This is an instance of the general security principle known as defense in depth, which aims to ensure that no failure of a single mechanism is enough to compromise your API

The principle of defense in depth states that multiple layers of security defenses should be used so that a failure in any one layer is not enough to breach the security of the whole system.

Retry-After Header

The rate limit for individual servers should be a fraction of the overall rate limit you want your service to handle. If your service needs to handle a thousand requests per second, and you have 10 servers, then the per-server rate limit should be around 100 request per second. You should verify that each server is able to handle this maximum rate.

❶ Create the shared rate limiter object and allow just 2 API requests per second.

❷ Check if the rate has been exceeded.

❸ If so, add a Retry-After header indicating when the client should retry.

❹ Return a 429 Too Many Requests status.

## Authentication to prevent spoofing

Authentication occurs after rate-limiting but before audit logging or access control. All requests proceed, even if authentication fails, to ensure that they are always logged. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected during access control, which occurs after audit logging.

### HTTP Basic authentication

This is a simple standard scheme, specified in RFC 7617 ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617)), in which the username and password are encoded (using Base64 encoding; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)) and sent in a header. An example of a Basic authentication header for the username `demo` and password `changeit` is as follows:

`Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpjaGFuZ2VpdA==`

Hash password - Use Salt and recommended config numbers

A salt is a random value that is mixed into the password when it is hashed. Salts ensure that the hash is always different even if two users have the same password. Without salts, an attacker can build a compressed database of common password hashes, known as a rainbow table, which allows passwords to be recovered very quickly.

Establish secure defaults for all security-sensitive algorithms and parameters used in your API. Only relax the values if there is no other way to achieve your non-security requirements.

FILTER ALGO : 

1 Check to see if there is an HTTP Basic Authorization header.

2 Decode the credentials using Base64 and UTF-8.

3 Split the credentials into username and password.

4 If the user exists, then use the Scrypt library to check the password.

5 Populate principal


## Using encryption to keep data private - Tampering/ Info disclosure

Run over HTTPS

When a user visits a website in a browser, the browser will first attempt to connect to the non-secure HTTP version of a page as many websites still do not support HTTPS

best practice is to immediately redirect them to the HTTPS version of the API and to set the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header to instruct the browser to always use the HTTPS version in future

`response.header("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000");`


## Audit logging for accountability - Repudiation

Accountability relies on being able to determine who did what and when. The simplest way to do this is to keep a log of actions that people perform using your API, known as an audit log

Audit logging should occur after authentication, so that you know who is performing an action, but before you make authorization decisions that may deny access

It’s difficult to overstate the importance of good audit logging to the security of an API. Audit logs should be written to durable storage, such as the file system or a database, so that the audit logs will survive if the process crashes for any reason.

 Audit logging should occur both before a request is processed and after it completes. When implemented as a filter, it should be placed after authentication, so that you know who is performing each action, but before access control checks so that you record operations that were attempted but denied.


In a production environment you typically will want to send audit logs to a centralized log collection and analysis tool, known as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system, so they can be correlated with logs from other systems and analyzed for potential threats and unusual behavior.

Often the users that can access audit logs (auditors) are different from the normal system administrators, as administrator accounts are the most privileged and so most in need of monitoring. This is an important security principle known as separation of duties.


The principle of separation of duties requires that different aspects of privileged actions should be controlled by different people, so that no one person is solely responsible for the action. For example, a system administrator should not also be responsible for managing the audit logs for that system. In financial systems, separation of duties is often used to ensure that the person who requests a payment is not also the same person who approves the payment, providing a check against fraud.

Implementation

You split the logging into two filters, one that occurs before the request is processed (after authentication), and one that occurs after the response has been produced

 generate a unique audit log ID in the `auditRequestStart` method and add it as an attribute to the request. In the `auditRequestEnd` method, you can then retrieve the same audit log ID so that the two log events can be tied together.

## Access control

Access control should happen after authentication, so that you know who is trying to perform the action, as shown in figure 3.7. If the request is granted, then it can proceed through to the application logic. However, if it is denied by the access control rules, then it should be failed immediately, and an error response returned to the user. The two main HTTP status codes for indicating that access has been denied are 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden

Access control occurs after authentication and the request has been logged for audit. If access is denied, then a forbidden response is immediately returned without running any of the application logic. If access is granted, then the request proceeds as normal.

A standard `WWW-Authenticate` header can be returned to tell the client what credentials it needs, which it will then return in the `Authorization` header

The `403` `Forbidden` status code, on the other hand, tells the client that its credentials were fine for authentication, but that it’s not allowed to perform the operation it requested

`response.header("WWW-Authenticate","Basic realm=\"/\", charset=\"UTF-8\"")`

### Access control lists

An access control list is a list of users that can access a given object, together with a set of permissions that define what each user can do.

Access control checks are often included directly in business logic, because who has access to what is ultimately a business decision. This also ensures that access control rules are consistently applied no matter how that functionality is accessed. On the other hand, separating out the access control checks makes it easier to centralize policy management

Implementation

❸ First check if the user is authenticated.

❹ Look up permissions for the current user in the given space, defaulting to no permissions.

❺ If the user doesn’t have permission, then halt with a 403 Forbidden status.

Should be Implemented as Filter


Problems

A privilege escalation (or elevation of privilege) occurs when a user with limited permissions can exploit a bug in the system to grant themselves or somebody else more permissions than they have been granted.

Solutions :

1. You can require that the permissions granted to the new user are no more than the permissions that are granted to the existing user. That is, you should ensure that evildemo2 is only granted the same access as the demo2 user.
    
2. You can require that only users with all permissions can add other users.
