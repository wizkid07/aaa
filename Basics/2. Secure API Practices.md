### Summary

- SQL injection attacks can be avoided by using prepared statements and parameterized queries.
    
- Database users should be configured to have the minimum privileges they need to perform their tasks. If the API is ever compromised, this limits the damage that can be done.
    
- Inputs should be validated before use to ensure they match expectations. Regular expressions are a useful tool for input validation, but you should avoid ReDoS attacks.
    
- Even if your API does not produce HTML output, you should protect web browser clients from XSS attacks by ensuring correct JSON is produced with correct headers to prevent browsers misinterpreting responses as HTML.
    
- Standard HTTP security headers should be applied to all responses, to ensure that attackers cannot exploit ambiguity in how browsers process results. Make sure to double-check all error responses, as these are often forgotten.


### NOTES

1. Always set correct response headers. Like application/json

## Injection attacks


1. How ?
		1. An injection attack occurs when unvalidated user input is included directly in a dynamic command or query that is executed by the application, allowing an attacker to control the code that is executed.
		
2. When ? 
		1. - Building an SQL command or query to send to a database
		2. - Running an operating system command
		3. - Performing a lookup in an LDAP directory
		4. - Sending an HTTP request to another API
		5. - Generating an HTML page to send to a web browser

	If user input is included in any of these cases in an uncontrolled way, the user may be able to influence the command or query to have unintended effects. This type of vulnerability is known as an injection attack and is often qualified with the type of code being injected: SQL injection (or SQLi), LDAP injection, and so on.
		
	Header Attack:
		
	There are examples of injection vulnerabilities that do not involve code being executed at all. For example, HTTP headers are lines of text separated by carriage return and new line characters ("`\r\n`" in Java). If you include unvalidated user input in a HTTP header then an attacker may be able to add a "`\r\n`" character sequence and then inject their own HTTP headers into the response. The same can happen when you include user-controlled data in debug or audit log messages (see chapter 3), allowing an attacker to inject fake log messages into the log file to confuse somebody later attempting to investigate an attack.

Example

```
$ curl -i -d "{\"name\": \"test\",\"owner\": 
➥  \"'); DROP TABLE spaces; --\"}" http://localhost:4567/spaces
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:51:06 GMT
Location: /spaces/9
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.4.8.v20171121)
 
{"name":"', ''); DROP TABLE spaces; --","uri":"/spaces/9"}
```


Solution:

1. A prepared statement is a SQL statement with all user input replaced with placeholders. When the statement is executed the input values are supplied separately, ensuring the database can never be tricked into executing user input as code.

2. The principle of least authority (POLA), also known as the principle of least privilege, says that all users and processes in a system should be given only those permissions that they need to do their job--no more, and no less.  Grant just the permissions it needs.

## Input validation

What ?

Security flaws often occur when an attacker can submit inputs that violate your assumptions about how the code should operate. For example, you might assume that an input can never be more than a certain size. If you’re using a language like C or C++ that lacks memory safety, then failing to check this assumption can lead to a serious class of attacks known as buffer overflow attacks. Even in a memory-safe language, failing to check that the inputs to an API match the developer’s assumptions can result in unwanted behavior.

Problems that may occur

1. Buffer overflow
	1.  A buffer overflow or buffer overrun occurs when an attacker can supply input that exceeds the size of the memory region allocated to hold that input. If the program, or the language runtime, fails to check this case then the attacker may be able to overwrite adjacent memory.
2.  Insecure deserialization vulnerability
	1. native deserialization mechanisms can sometimes be repurposed for malicious effect when operating on untrusted data. Attacks against deserializers have been found to allow denial-of-service, access control, or remote code execution (RCE) attacks.
3. A database is a valuable asset that your API should be protecting from invalid requests. Sending requests to the database that contain basic errors just ties up resources that you would rather use processing genuine requests
4. ReDos
	1. A regular expression denial of service (or ReDoS) attack occurs when a regular expression can be forced to take a very long time to match a carefully chosen input string. This can happen if the regular expression implementation can be forced to back-track many times to consider different possible ways the expression might match.

Preventation:

1. Validate Input 
	1. Always define acceptable inputs rather than unacceptable ones when validating untrusted input. An allow list describes exactly which inputs are considered valid and rejects anything else.[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/api-security-in/9781617296024/OEBPS/Text/02.htm#pgfId-1143899) A blocklist (or deny list), on the other hand, tries to describe which inputs are invalid and accepts anything else. Blocklists can lead to security flaws if you fail to anticipate every possible malicious input. Where the range of inputs may be large and complex, such as Unicode text, consider listing general classes of acceptable inputs like “decimal digit” rather than individual input values.


## Producing safe output

In addition to validating all inputs, an API should also take care to ensure that the outputs it produces are well-formed and cannot be abused

Example :

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2019 15:21:16 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(9.4.8.v20171121)
 
{"error": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid username: a really long username that is more than 30 characters long"}
```

Problems with this
1. It includes details of the exact Java exception that was thrown. Although not a vulnerability by itself, these kinds of details in outputs help a potential attacker to learn what technologies are being used to power an API.
2. XSS can be done. It echoes back the erroneous input that the user supplied in the response and doesn’t do a good job of escaping it. When the API client might be a web browser, this can result in a vulnerability known as reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
3. The Content-Type header in the response is set to `text/html` rather than the expected `application/json`. Combined with the previous issue, this increases the chance that an XSS attack could be pulled off against a web browser client.

Preventions:
1. Remove unnecessary headers
2. You can remove the leak of the exception class details by changing the exception handler to only return the error message not the full class

Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a common vulnerability affecting web applications, in which an attacker can cause a script to execute in the context of another site. In a persistent XSS, the script is stored in data on the server and then executed whenever a user accesses that data through the web application.

Reflected XSS is slightly harder to exploit because a victim has to be tricked into visiting a website under the attacker’s control to trigger the attack. A third type of XSS, known as DOM-based XSS, attacks JavaScript code that dynamically creates HTML in the browser.


These can be devastating to the security of a web application, allowing an attacker to potentially steal session cookies and other credentials, and to read and alter data in that session

To appreciate why XSS is such a risk, you need to understand that the security model of web browsers is based on the same-origin policy (SOP). Scripts executing within the same origin (or same site) as a web page are, by default, able to read cookies set by that website, examine HTML elements created by that site, make network requests to that site, and so on, although scripts from other origins are blocked from doing those things. A successful XSS allows an attacker to execute their script as if it came from the target origin, so the malicious script gets to do all the same things that the genuine scripts from that origin can do. If I can successfully exploit an XSS vulnerability on facebook.com, for example, my script could potentially read and alter your Facebook posts or steal your private messages.

Although XSS is primarily a vulnerability in web applications, in the age of single-page apps (SPAs) it’s common for web browser clients to talk directly to an API. For this reason, it’s essential that an API take basic precautions to avoid producing output that might be interpreted as a script when processed by a web browser.

**The XSS protections in browsers have been found to cause security vulnerabilities of their own in some cases. The OWASP project now recommends always disabling the filter with the `X-XSS-Protection:` `0` header as shown previously.**


How to do a sample XSS

![[Screenshot 2023-09-26 at 7.58.54 PM.png]]

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against your API can occur when an attacker gets a web browser client to submit a form with carefully crafted input fields. When submitted, the form looks like valid JSON to the API, which parses it but then produces an error message. Because the response is incorrectly returned with a HTML content-type, the malicious script that the attacker provided is executed by the web browser client.

Prevention : 

- Be strict in what you accept. If your API consumes JSON input, then require that all requests include a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`. This prevents the form submission tricks that you used in this example, as a HTML form cannot submit `application/json` content.
    
- Ensure all outputs are well-formed using a proper JSON library rather than by concatenating strings.
    
- Produce correct `Content-Type` headers on all your API’s responses, and never assume the defaults are sensible. Check error responses in particular, as these are often configured to produce HTML by default.
    
- If you parse the `Accept` header to decide what kind of output to produce, never simply copy the value of that header into the response. Always explicitly specify the `Content-Type` that your API has produced.
